\textbf{Neijing Tu Entity} & 
\textbf{Plasma Equivalent} & 
\textbf{Taxonomic Equivalent} & 
\textbf{Function as Plasma} & 
\textbf{Function as Form-Finding Tensegrity} \\
\hline

Lao Tzu & 
Degenerate Plasma & 
Kingdom & 
Extreme density states (e.g., white dwarfs, neutron stars); dominated by Pauli exclusion principles. & 
Root level of differentiation; the broadest container of life forms (e.g., animal, plant, fungi). \\
\hline

Buddha & 
Dusty Plasma & 
Phylum & 
Charged dust particles; field-mediated structuring at intermediate scales. & 
Defines fundamental body plans; the first major evolutionary branching (e.g., vertebrates vs. invertebrates). \\
\hline

Child on the Star Bridge & 
Radiative Plasma & 
Class & 
Photon-dominated field interactions; associated with high-energy boson activity (e.g., EM radiation). & 
Refines developmental traits through organizational structure (e.g., mammals, reptiles). \\
\hline

The Weaver (Vega) & 
Ionic Plasma & 
Order & 
Weak and strong ionic interactions; basis of hadronic structure and energetic coherence. & 
Patterns of specialization (e.g., primates vs. carnivores); refines behavioral and functional dynamics. \\
\hline

The Oxherd (Altair) & 
Relativistic Plasma & 
Family & 
High-speed, charge-separated plasma; associated with fermions in motion and relativistic behavior. & 
Clarifies evolutionary relationships (e.g., hominids, felines); links inherited traits with function. \\
\hline

Yin \& Yang & 
Magnetic Plasma & 
Genus \& Species & 
Field interactions responsible for coherence, charge separation, and quantum mirroring. & 
Final differentiation of form; dynamic balance of adaptive traits between stability and change. \\
